## Introduction
A general protocol on how to operate the FTIR.

## Material and Equipment

## Procedure (cryptic notes from my first FTIR day)
1. Get FTIR cell into a glove box, togehter with imbus. If the overpressure thing is atteched, make sure its open, so that you dont bring inside oxygen.
2. Place Protein Sample (up to 3 µL) in the middle of the crystal. Don't let it touch the walls!
3. Place the rubber ring on top, and put on the other part of the cell. Tighten with imbus.
4. The rest will happen all on Floor 0.
5. Place the cell into the FTIR.
6. Close the pathway, and purge with N2. Then close lower Purge gate. Output on the bottom right corner of the measuring chamber.
7. Open the Program OPUS (PW: OPUS)
8. We have two sorts of detector one XXXX and another one xxx that needs cooling.
9. To cool the detector, fill in the back left corner of the device with lq N2. Fill. Wait. Repeat until no boiling can be heard.
10. Check the lower right corner (device/program?) switching from red to green --> ready!
11. repeated ?
12. spectral ray collect: ??
13. beam path
14. check signal (Max Am 32 000)
15. OPTIC: Settings
	1. Detector setting --> LNMCT
16. Advance, Experiment load --> .xpm load --> change file name
17. Background header, make background and scan, then load ?


### Detector Set Up
1. cool down the funnel in liquid N2. When the funnel is overflowing the cooling is done. 

### Software Set Up
Program --> OPUS 5.5, Password: OPUS
Menü --> advanced measurments 
Pop-up Window
	Basic: 
		- sample name
		- description
	Advanced:
		- File name
		- Folder name
		- Resolution - 2 cm-1 (3 cm-1)
		- sample time scan (500-1000, 750 is the best!)
		- Absorbance mode
	Optic settings
		- Aperature 9mm
		- Detector MCT (?)
		- Scan velocity (low velocity better signal)
	Aquisition
		- Double sided / Forward - Backward
