# Cyanide FTIR Probing

**Last Updated**: 2023-08-31
**Authors**: Max

## Introduction
The idea is to probe the assembly of the active site of NiCODH by incubating the protein with CN and then trying to see the characteristic CN-Metal-Cluster vibration.

## Material and Equipment
- Enzyme (400 µM)
- Potassium cyanide (M = 65.12 g/mol) 🥼🥽🧤❗
- Buffer A: Tris–HCl 50 mM pH 8, NaCl 100 mM, dithionite (DT) 4 mM (0.696 mg/mL)
- Sodium dithionite (DT) (M = 174.107 g/mol) 🥽
- Microcon® Centrifugal Filters (cut-off 100 kDa)
- FTIR (booked?)

## Procedure
#### CN bound CODH
1. Buffer A should be prepared fresh, by mixing Buffer A' (Tris–HCl 50 mM pH 8, NaCl 100 mM) with appropriate amounts of sodium dithionite (DT). You dont need much, total of 5 mL is enough. 
2. For this weigh in 3.5 mg NaDT in a 15 mL Falcon Tube, bring inside glovebox and mix with 5 mL Buffer A'.
3. Then use 6 μL of CODH (400 μM) and add to 500 μL of buffer A (Tris–HCl 50 mM pH 8, NaCl 100 mM, NaDT 4 mM)
	1. The CN-bound signal is very small, so more is more in regards of enzyme concentration! Especially if you already know your nickel occupancy is low.
4. incubated for 45 min at RT.
5. Meanwhile weigh in approx 6.5 mg KCN, and bring inside glovebox, and dissolve to 6.5 mg/ml in buffer A.
6. Then 5 µL of this Potassium cyanide (100 mM (6.5 mg/ml)) is added to the sample (final conc 1 mM)
7. incubated for 30 min under occasional shaking
8. reaction mixtures washed several times using Microcon® Centrifugal Filters (cut-off 100 kDa) with buffer A and reductant 
9. finally concentrated to 10 μL 
10. injection into the transmission cell. 

#### FTIR measurement
see [[How-To-FTIR]]
- Band of free CN- (2080 cm-1) and free HCN(aq) (2093 cm-1)
- Metal/Cluster Bound CN at 2110 cm-1 
## Notes
- To prevent harm from cyanide handle with care!
- Waste should be made basic with excess of NaOH tablets. And should be occasionally tested with pH strips! The pKa of HCN is 9.2, therefore you should be well above pH 10 to have "no" HCN present, which is volatile and highly toxic.
- Dispose waste separately!

- that a single cyanide binds to the Ni ion
- degradation of the C-cluster occurred in the presence of an excess of cyanide on the long-minute time scale
- formation of [Fe(CN)6]4− and [Ni(CN)4]2−
- vibration at 2110 cm-1
- pK_a value for HCN is 9.21--> mix of CN- (2080 cm-1) and HCN(aq) (2093 cm-1) if pH lower than 9.21--> concentation of CN- is an estimate

Original protocol:
**Protocol A:** 
6 μL of CODHII_Ch_ 400 μM were diluted in 500 μL of buffer A (Tris–HCl 50 mM pH 8, NaCl 100 mM) containing either dithionite (DT) 4 mM or titanium citrate (Ti(iii) citrate) 5 mM and incubated for 45 min. Cyanide (1 mM) was added to the sample and allowed to react with CODHII_Ch_ for 30 min under gentle stirring. The CODHII_Ch_ sample was subsequently washed several times using Microcon® Centrifugal Filters (cut-off 100 kDa) with buffer A and reductant in order to remove excess cyanide and finally concentrated to 10 μL prior to injection into the transmission cell. 
**Protocol B (does not work!)**: 
6 μL of CODHII_Ch_ 400 μM were added to 6 μL of an inhibition mixture containing cyanide (ranging from 2 to 20 mM) and DT (4 mM) in buffer A. Finally, 10–12 μL of the inhibited CODHII_Ch_ sample, which was prepared according to procedures described above, was injected into a gas-tight transmission cell.
