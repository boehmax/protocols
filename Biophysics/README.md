# Biophysics Protocols

This directory contains protocols for biophysical characterization techniques commonly used in protein and enzyme research.

## Available Protocols

### Spectroscopy
- **[FTIR Setup Guide](./How-To-FTIR.md)** - Complete guide for FTIR instrument operation and sample preparation
- **[Cyanide FTIR Probing](./Cyanide-FTIR-Probing.md)** - Specialized protocol for studying CN‚Åª binding to metal centers using FTIR spectroscopy

### Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR)
- **[EPR Cryo Setup](./EPR_cryo_setUP.md)** - Detailed procedure for cryogenic EPR sample preparation and instrument setup

## General Notes

- All spectroscopic protocols require careful sample preparation to avoid contamination
- EPR measurements are particularly sensitive to oxygen exposure - work under anaerobic conditions when required
- Instrument-specific calibration and safety procedures should be followed
- Contact instrument responsible person before first use
