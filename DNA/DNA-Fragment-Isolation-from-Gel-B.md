# DNA Fragment Isolation from Gel

**Last Updated**: unknown
**Authors**: Briggi

## Introduction



## Material and Equipment




## Procedure
1. Make a thick gel with thick combs (you can load 20 µL into 1 well)
2. Set up your digestion

| Stuff | Amount|
|:------------------------------------------|-------------:|
| DNA (plasmid)                            | 2 µg        |
| Enzyme 1                                 | 2 µL        |
| Enzyme 2                                 | 2 µL        |
| FastAP (if you want to keept the vector) | 2 µL        |
| 10x FD green buffer                      | 2 µL        |
| dH2O                                     | up to 20 µl |

3. Digest 20 to 25 min at 37C
4. Load on the gel (7 µL from marker)
5. 96V 45 min
6. Cut the bands
7. Weigh it: 0.xyz g 
8. Add 3 times xyz µL ADB and 1 time xyz µL isoprop
9. Melt at 55C
10. Load on the collume
11. Wash 3 times with 200 µL washing buffer
12. Elute in 20 µL with dH2O
13. Nanodrop
