# Iron Determination micro assay

**Last Updated**: unknown
**Authors**: unknown, Briggi, Max

## Introduction
Iron determination assay for very small amounts of iron in a sample, eg protein. 

## Material and Equipment
- Iron(II) standard (1005 µg/mL) (commercial atomic absorption standard solution)
- 1 M perchloric acid
- Bathophenantrolinedisufonic acid, disodium salt
- Sodium ascorbate
- Saturated solution of ammonium acetate


## Procedure
### Calibration curve:
1. Dilute the iron standard with water, so that 1 µL of solution contains 0.5 nmol Fe(II)
2. Prepare solutions with different amounts of Fe according to table. Final Volume each 65 µL.

| Final amount Fe (nmol)       | 0  | 2  | 4  | 6  | 8  | 10 |
|:-----------------------------|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Diluted Fe(II) solution [µL] | 0  | 4  | 8  | 12 | 16 | 20 |
| dH2O [µL]                    | 65 | 61 | 57 | 53 | 49 | 45 |

3. Add then 45 µL perchloric acid (1 M) to each tube. Vortex, then incubate for at least 15 min at room temperature.
2. Meanwhile, prepare fresh solutions of...
	1. bathophenantrolinedisufonic acid, disodium salt (3.02 mg/mL)
	2. sodium ascorbate (38 mg/mL)
	3. 1/3 diluted staturated ammonium acetate solution
1. Transfer 90 µL from each sample tube to new tubes and add above listed solutions. (72 µL, 36 µL, 27 µL, respectively)
2. Mix vigorously immediately after the addition of ammonium acetate. A pink colour develops quickly.
3. Incubate at room temperature for 30 min.
4. Measure Abs at 535 nm. Plot Abs against amount of Fe.

### Analysing protein samples
1. Use up to 65 µL of a protein sample, complete with water if necessary
2. After incubation with perchloric acid, centrifuge the sample to remove precipitated protein. Proceed with the same method as used for calibration curve.

## Notes
- Make calibration curve with same pipets as used for your protein sample
- Check smell of saturated ammonium acetate occasionally. If it only smells like ammonium but not acetate, make a new one.
- Saturated ammonium acetate solution is 148 g per 100 ml at r.t.
- Princess experienced that the 30 min incubation before measuring can be shortened to 5 min, without difference.
