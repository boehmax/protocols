# Chemistry Protocols

This directory contains analytical chemistry protocols for metal analysis and quantitative measurements commonly used in metalloproteins research.

## Available Protocols

### Metal Analysis
- **[ICP-OES Protocol](./ICP-OES-Protocol.md)** - Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy for multi-element metal analysis
- **[Iron Microassay](./Iron-Determination-microassay-B.md)** - Colorimetric iron content determination for small sample volumes

## Applications

### ICP-OES Analysis
- Quantitative determination of metal concentrations in protein samples
- Multi-element analysis capability (Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mo, etc.)
- Detection limits in μg/L range
- Requires sample preparation with acid digestion

### Iron Microassay
- Specific for iron content determination
- Suitable for small sample volumes (μL range)
- Colorimetric detection method
- Compatible with protein samples in buffer

## Important Considerations

### Sample Preparation
- ICP-OES requires acid digestion - proteins will be destroyed
- Iron microassay is non-destructive for small aliquots
- Use metal-free tips and containers
- Avoid contamination from metal surfaces

### Instrument Access
- ICP-OES requires instrument booking and training
- Contact instrument responsible before use
- Allow sufficient time for sample queue and analysis

### Quality Control
- Use appropriate standards and blanks
- Run duplicates for important samples
- Document all sample preparation steps

## Safety Notes

- Handle concentrated acids with appropriate PPE
- Work in fume hood for acid digestion
- Follow instrument-specific safety protocols
- Dispose of acid waste appropriately
