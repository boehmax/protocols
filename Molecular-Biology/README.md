# Molecular Biology Protocols

This directory contains fundamental molecular biology techniques for bacterial work, cloning, and genetic manipulation.

## Available Protocols

### Competent Cells
- **[Chemical Competent E. Coli](./Chemical-Competent-E-Coli.md)** - CaCl₂-based competent cell preparation (standard method)
- **[Chemically Competent Cell Preparation](./Chemically-competent-cell-preparation-B.md)** - Alternative competent cell protocol

### Transformation
- **[Transformation (Single Plasmid)](./Transformation-of-chemically-competent-Cells.md)** - Basic transformation protocol for single plasmids
- **[Transformation (Multiple Plasmids)](./Transformation-of-multiple-Plasmids.md)** - Specialized protocol for co-transformation of multiple plasmids

### Bacterial Storage
- **[Glycerol Stock](./Glycerol-Stock.md)** - Long-term bacterial strain storage at -80°C

## Protocol Guidelines

### Competent Cell Preparation
- Both competent cell protocols produce high-efficiency cells suitable for most cloning applications
- The "-B" version offers an alternative approach if the standard method doesn't work well with your bacterial strain
- Freshly prepared competent cells generally give higher transformation efficiency

### Transformation Tips
- Use appropriate antibiotic selection based on plasmid resistance markers
- For multiple plasmid transformations, ensure compatible selection markers
- Calculate transformation efficiency using known control plasmids

### Best Practices
- Maintain sterile technique throughout all procedures
- Use fresh, high-quality reagents
- Keep cells cold during competent cell preparation and transformation
- Test competent cell efficiency with control plasmids before important experiments
