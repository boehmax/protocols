**Last Updated**: 2023-11-10
**Authors**: Max

## Introduction

## Material and Equipment
All materials are calculated for 1 plasmid, multiply by the amount of plasmids you want to transform. For concentrations see [[Chemical-Competent-E-Coli]]

- 50 mL LB for ON culture 
- 100 mL LB medium in autoclaved Erlenmeyer Flask for growth
- CaCl2 solution (sterile)
- CaCl2, glycerol solution (sterile)
- LB-agar plates with appropriate antibiotics
- 2 Falcon Tubes
- Sterile 1.5mL Eppendorf tubes
- Sterile 1 mL Tips
- Sterile 200ÂµL Tips

## Procedure

### Day 1
- Transform first Plasmid into competent cells
- Pick colonies at the end of the day and make overnight culture.

### Day 3
- Make competent cells form overnight culture
- Transform next plasmid
