## Introduction
Tiny Protocol for making a glycerol stock of bacteria.

## Material and Equipment
- LB
- Plated Bacteria
- Glycerol
- Cryotube 
- lq N2

## Procedure

1. Make overnight culter of your bacterial colony in LB medium.
1. Prepare Cryo Tube. Write on it the following: Cell Type, plasmid and gen that they carry, Date, your name, maybe antibiotik recistence (but this could be related to the plasmid)
1. Mix Cell culter with Glycerol so that you have 25% Glycerol at the end. Eg. 500 µL ON culter + 500 µL 50% Glycerol
		- Try not to use too little of the ON culter. Eg 100 µL + 900 µL = bad!!
1. Freez cells in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 C. Don't let them thaw, ever again.
