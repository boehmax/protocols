# Transformation of chemically competent Cells

**Last Updated**: 2022-10-28
**Authors**: Briggi, Max

## Introduction

"Transform: To put DNA into an organisms." 

## Material and Equipment
- Competent cells
- DNA 
- LB or SOC medium
- 20% glucose (optional)
- LB-Plates
- Ice

## Procedure
1. Thaw competent cells on ice (30 min).
2. Add DNA. Incubate for 15 to 30 min on ice. Longer time for less competent cells sometimes helps.
3. Heat Shock.
	1. Place for 45 sec in 42C water bath
	2. Place for up to 10 min on ice. We do 2 min.
1. Add 900 µL SOC or LB and 20 µL 20% glucose. The glucose is optional.
2. Incubate for 1 h at 37C, under shaking.
3. Spread them to a LB plate. If you are not sure how competent the cells are or how easily the plasmid will be taken up, make sure that you spread different amounts on multiple plates. Eg 10µL 50µL 100µL. For very not-competent cells, spin remaining cells down, resuspend in 100µL and plate all 100µL.
4. Keep in incubator over night at 37C. 
5. Next day find colonies! ❤️ Good Job!


## Notes
- 1 L of LB plates would be 15g Aga and 20 g LB powder. --> 4g Aga and 200 mL LB. After autoclaving microwave until melted. Add antibioics when handwarm.
