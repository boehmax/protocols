# Chemical Competent E. Coli
**Last Updated**: 2022-08-18
**Authors**: Max

## Introduction
How to make chemical competent E. coli, with CaCl2. This was taken from "Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Unit 1.8 2001". It has been adapted with the knowledge of our lab. 

___
## Material
### Chemicals
- Calcium Chloride, 0.1 M
- Calcium Chloride, 0.1 M with 15 % Glycerol (v/v)
- LB Medium
### Equipment
- Steriel Erlenmeyer Flask
- Steriel Tips (1 mL, 5 mL, 200 µL)
- Sterile Falcon Tubes
- Sterile 1.5 mL Tubes (Eppis)
- Falcon Tube Centrifuge (cooled)
- ICE!

___
## Procedure
### Day 1
- Inoculate a single colony of E. coli cells into 50 ml LB medium. Grow overnight at
37°C with moderate shaking.
### Day 2
1. Inoculate 4 ml of the culture into 400 ml LB medium in a sterile 2-liter flask. Grow
at 37°C, shaking at 250 rpm, to an OD590 of 0.4-0.5.
	*This procedure requires that cells be growing rapidly (early- or mid-log phase). Accordingly, it is very important that the growing cells have sufficient air.*
2. Aliquot culture into 50-ml prechilled, sterile polypropylene tubes and leave the
tubes on ice 5 to 10 min.
	*Cells should be kept cold for all subsequent steps.*
1. Centrifuge cells 7 min at 1600 × g (3000 rpm in JS-5.2), 4°C. Allow centrifuge to
decelerate without brake.
	*We have not attempted to determine whether deceleration without braking is critical to this procedure. However, we do not use the brake for this step or for the subsequent centrifugation steps.*
1. Pour off supernatant and resuspend each pellet in 10 ml ice-cold CaCl2 solution.
Resuspension should be performed **very gently** and all cells kept on ice.
1. Centrifuge cells 5 min at 1100 × g (2500 rpm), 4°C. Discard supernatant and
resuspend each pellet in 10 ml ice-cold CaCl2 solution. Keep resuspended cells on
ice for 30 min.
1. Centrifuge cells 5 min at 1100 × g, 4°C. Discard supernatant and resuspend each
pellet in 2 ml ice-cold CaCl2 solution with 15% Glycerol.
	*It is important to resuspend this final pellet well. The suspension may be left on ice for several days. For many strains (e.g., DH1) competency increases with increasing time on ice, and reaches a maximum at 12 to 24 hr. This is not true for MC1061 cells, which should be frozen immediately.*
1. Dispense cells into prechilled, sterile polypropylene tubes (100-μl aliquots are
convenient). Freeze immediately at −70°C.
