# Chemically competent cell preperation

**Last Updated**: unknown
**Authors**: Briggi, Max

## Introduction

## Material and Equipment
### SOC (500 mL)
- 0.25 g NaCl
- 10 g Trypton
- 2.5 g Yeast Extract
- 1.23 g MgSO4 x 7H2O
### TB buffer (500 mL)
- 1.5 g PIPES
- 5.45 g MnCl2
- 1.1 g CaCl2
- 9.32 g KCl
Set pH with KOH **before** adding MnCl2!


## Procedure
1. Inoculate into 60 mL SOC
2. Incubate until OD 600 = 0.4 to 0.6 at 37C
3. Ice 10 min
4. Centrifuge 5000 rpm 4C 10 min
5. Resuspend in 16 ml precooled TB buffer
6. Ice 10 min
7. Centrifuge 5000 rpm 4C 10 min
8. Resuspend in 4 mL precooled TB buffer
9. Add 300 µL DMSO
10. Ice 10 min
11. Aliquoting into precooled Eppendorf tubes. (100 to 200 µL)
	- Keep one for testing tranformation 
12. Freezing in liquid N2.
13. Store at -80C


## Notes
- In Briggis protocol it didn't say what pH it should be set. [Online](https://lab.rockefeller.edu/chen/assets/file/Protocol-for-high-efficiency-chemically-competent-Ecoli-.pdf) I found pH 6.7. But they do it a little differently.
- LB is apparently also fine instead of SOC.
- Everything should be super cold!
- Everything should be sterile!
