# Protein pDot Interaction Electrophoresis

**Last Updated**: 2023-04-26
**Authors**: Mariia, Max

## Introduction
To determine the interaction between proteins and pdots a simple electrophoresis experiment can be conducted. It has been shown that polyacrylamid gels are unsuitable for pdots. Therefore an agarose gel electrophoresis procedure was developed by Mariia.


## Material and Equipment
- Agarose (pure)
- Running Buffer: 1x TAE buffer (see Notes)
- 4x Loading Buffer (see Notes)
- Protein (100 µM)
- pdots (125 ng/mL)
- Fixing Solution: v/v 40%/10%/50% EtOH/AcOH/H2O
- Staining solution: [Thermofischer](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/24620) 

## Procedure
### Gel casting
A gel chamber that we have holds approx. 20 mL. It has been shown that for this purpose a concentration of 0.8% w/v agarose is best suited.
1. Mix Running Buffer with agarose accordingly.
2. Heat in microwave until dissolved. Be carful! Avoid overboiling. 
3. Cast the hot liquid in casting tray. 
4. Remove bubbles with clean pipette tip.
5. Insert comb.
6. Let solidify for approx. 30 min.
### Sample Preparation
1. Premix pdots and protein 1 h before mixing with the loading buffer.
2. Prepare the samples as such:

| Name           | Protein [µL] | pdots [µL] | loading buffer [µL] | dH2O [µL] |
| -------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------------- | ---- |
| Protein        | 5            | 0          | 5                   | 10   |
| pDot           | 0            | 5          | 5                   | 10   |
| Protein + pdot | 5            | 5          | 5                   | 5     |
### Loading and Running the Gel
1. Fill wells in gel with fresh TEA buffer, and the anodic and cathodic chambers with reused TEA buffer.
2. Carefully load 10 µL of the samples in the wells. 
3. Adjust voltage to 150 V and press start.
4. Take a picture of the gel every 30 min with the UV camera. Be carfull not to destroy the gel.
5. After the pdots have travelled some distance stop the run. 
### Staining the gel
To make the protein visible on the gel we need to stain it with a protein specific dye.
1. Fixate the protein into place by incubating it in Fixing Solution for 30 min.
2. Rinse the gel carefully with dH2O.
3. Incubate it for 1 h or overnight in Staining solution. (make it dependent on when you see bands appear. It also depends on the staining solution itself how long you need to stain it. For solutions containing MeOH a shorter staining time is preferred.)
4. Rinse again with water and take a picture.
### Evaluation
Compare the last picture from the UV camera with the picture after the staining. 

## Notes
1x TEA Buffer:

Loading Buffer: 8 mg Bromphenol Blue, 4 g Glycerol, 2.5 mL 1 M Tris-HCl pH 7 fill up to 9 mL

For a 0.8 % Agarose gel:

| Volume | Agarose |
| ------ | ------- |
| 20 mL  | 0.16 g  |
| 50 mL  | 0.4 g   |
| 100 mL | 0.8 g   |
