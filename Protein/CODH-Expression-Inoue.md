# CODH Expression - Inoue

**Last Updated**: 2023-02-13
**Authors**: Max from [Inoue et al. (2011)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.110159)

## Introduction

How to express CODH II from C. hydrogenoformans in E Coli. An adapted protocol from [Inoue et al. (2011)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.110159). This protocoll is set up for **1 L of cell culture**. Last Updated: 2022-04-04

## Material and Equipment


- 3 L Erlmeyer flaks
- 1 L Erlmeyer flask with narrow neck
- Ampicillin (AMP)
- other Antibiotics
- FeSO4
- NiCl2
- NaNO3
- L-Cystein
- IPTG
- TB Medium
- 10x TB Salts: 0.17 M (23.1 g/L) KH2PO4, 0.72 M (125.4 g/L) K2HPO4

## Procedure

### To Dos before you start

- Book shakers!
- Book glovebox! (for Protein Purification)
- Prepare TB medium + autoclave it!
- Check if you have enough Phosphate buffer for TB. If not make some + sterile filter it!

### Day 0 - Starting an overnight culture

1. Prepare 15 ml LB medium with 100 µg/mL Ampicillin and appropriate amounts of Chlormamphenicol or Kanamycine. Stocks are prepared usually as 1000x. (Add 15 µL from stocks.)
2. Get transformed cells (e.g.  E. coli carrying CODH II plasmid and ISC plasmid) glycerol stock or from a plate. Add them to the LB medium
3. Put in the Incubator over night. 37C 190rpm. This is our *Overnight Culture*
4. Prepare in a 3 L Erlenmeyer bottle the TB medium. 24 g yeast extract, 12 g trypton, 5 g glycerol. Add 900 ml dH2O, cover opening with aluminum foil and autoclave. Some people add the glycerol after autoclaving.

### Day 1 - Culturing and Inducing

1. Turn on Shaker to let it heat up to 37 C.
2. Prepare Salt mixtures. (could be done day before)
	**Salt Mixture 1**: 2,592 mg NiCl2 (0,02 mM) or 20µL of 1 M, 27,8 mg FeSO4 (0,1 mM), 242,3 mg L-cysteine (2mM)
	**Salt Mixture 2**: 64,8 mg NiCl2 (0,5 mM) or 500µL of 1M, 278 mg FeSO4 (1,0 mM), 242,3 mg L-cysteine (2mM), 4,25 g KNO3 (50 mM)
3. Add 100 mL 10x Phosphate Buffer, dissolve Salt Mixture 1 and add to TB medium. Add 1 mL Ampicilin and other antibiotics from stocks in the freezer. Last add 10 mL overnight culture.
4. Incubate flask at 150 rpm at 37 C until a OD600 0.4 to 0.7 is reached. (Approx 2.5 h)
5. **Take Sample**. Measure OD. Spin cells down and store in the freezer till later use.
6. Transfer cells and medium into 1 L Erlenmeyer flask with narrow opening (Glas Schliff). Add magnetic stirrer, Antifoam and seal opening with septum.
8. Under vigorous stirring bubble with N2 gas for 30 min.
10. Dissolve Salt mix 2. Add little HCl if salts are not dissolving well. Take IPTG (1M) from the fridge and add 200 µL to Salt Mix 2.
11. Inject with a syringe the Mixture into the cells under continiuos N2 bubbeling. **DON'T** open the lids to keep an anaerobic atmosphere.
12. Incubate for 20 to 22 h at 150 rpm and 30 C.

### Day 2 - Harvesting (aerobically)

1. **Take Sample**. Measure OD. Spin cells down and store in the freezer till later use.
2. Transfer content of flasks into Beckman centrifugation tubes (400 ml, wide opening).
3. Centrifuge at 5000 rpm for 10 min.
4. Discharge the supernatant and collect cell pellet in new **labeled** falcon tubes. Use Buffer to re-suspend small leftovers in centrifugation buffers and combine them with cells in the falcon tubes.
5. Spin down cells in falcon tubes 5000 rpm for 10 min.
6. Discharge supernatant and freeze cells in liquid nitrogen. Store at -20 C for later use (up to 3 weeks, for longer storage store at -80C).
