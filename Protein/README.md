## Important Notes

### Safety & Handling
- Most protocols involve anaerobic conditions - proper glovebox/Schlenk techniques required
- Metal-containing proteins are sensitive to oxidation
- CO is toxic - work in well-ventilated areas
- Follow all chemical safety guidelines

### Best Practices
- Maintain strict anaerobic conditions throughout purification
- Keep proteins cold and minimize exposure time
- Use appropriate controls for all activity assays
- Document all modifications to protocols
