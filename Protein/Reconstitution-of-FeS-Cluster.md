# Reconstitution of FeS Cluster

**Last Updated**: unknown
**Authors**: Princess, Max

## Introduction
During the expression of Iron Sulfer (FeS) Cluster containing proteins, the insufficent assambly of them is a common problem. The clusters can be reconstructed *in vitro*, using this experimental procedure. Quelle: ???
**Note**: The protocol is set up to work in a Glovebox with a spectrophotometer. 


## Material and Equipment
- N2 purged Tris-HCl (100mM, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl)
- Dithiotheitol (DTT) (15 mg/mL, 97.2 mM)
- L-cysteine (14 mg/mL, 115.5 mM)
- Mohr's salt (47 mg/mL, 120 mM)
- Cystein desulfurase (CsdA) aliquot from -80 C freezer (20 µM stock)

- 2x 1 mm pathlength cuvett 
- at least 2x amicon centricons; 4x amicon tubes
- 2x 15 mL facontubes
- PD-10 coloumn (already in Jodie)

## Procedure
### Calculating reagents
The amount of Fe and cysteine that need to be added, depends on the "missing" irons in the protein. So before make sure to determine protein concentration and iron concentration of your sample. Enzyme is diluted in buﬀer (100 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8) to gain a ﬁnal concentration of 50 µM after adding every reagent. DTT: 10 eq, 500 µM
L-cysteine and Mohr’s salt were in excess: 1.5 times the number of iron atoms one wants to introduce into the FeS clusters system 
CsdA: 0.01 eq, 0.5 µM final conc

### Reaction
1.  Begin by recording a blank spectrum using Buffer only.
2.  In a falcon tube, combine Buffer, enzyme, and DTT. Incubate for 10 minutes and record a spectrum. This will be considered time point 0.
3.  Add L-Cys, Mohr's Salt, and CsdA to the falcon tube. Half-invert the tube gently and record a spectrum. This will be considered time point +0.
4.  Follow the reaction by recording a spectrum every 30 minutes until no further changes can be observed.
5.  Prepare a PD-10 column and wash it with at least 3 column volumes of Buffer.
6.  Load the reaction mixture onto the column. Once it enters completely, add 2-3 mL of Buffer gently on top. Ensure that the column does not run dry from this point forward.
7.  Collect the brown band in a fresh 15 mL falcon tube.
8.  Concentrate the protein using Amicon centrifugation.
9. Take a sample for iron and Bradford assay.
10.  Freeze the sample in liquid nitrogen for storage.

## Notes
The main absorbance area of interest is the absorbance at 350 ish nm. After a while the overall spectra will shift its absorbance. This is due to precipitation and is unwanted but happens. Let the reaction go as long as needed but not too long, as you protein might not be stable for extended periods at room temperature!
