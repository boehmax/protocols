## Material and Equipment




## Procedure





## Notes

I tried now different adhesion protocols:
Polishing out side, bring inside, add 16mg/ml 2uL enzyme
Polish inside, add 16mg/ml 2uL enzym
Polish inside add 3times more conc. polymyxin b 3uL with 2uL of 16mg/ml 2uL enzyme
So far non of them worked, in did it once with alina, and we though we saw a current, we premixed enzyme and polymyxin as above and added it, but after the first scan nothing
Patricia said we should start with CO oxidation, and she is right.
