# Activation of FeFe Hydrogenase with Synthetic Cofactors

**Last Updated**: unknown
**Authors**: Princess, Max

## Introduction
FeFe Hydrogenases, when expressed heterologously in E. Coli without maturation enzymes, lack their active site. This is no problem, since it can be inserted with this protocol.
**Note**: The protocol is set up to work in a Glovebox. 


## Material and Equipment
- N2 purged NaPi (pH 6.8, 100 mM), activation buffer
- N2 purged Tris-HCl (pH 8, 100 mM)
- N2 purged dH2O
- Sodium dithionited (NaDT) (3.48 mg/mL) (Eppi) ðŸ¥½
- NaDT (17.4 mg/mL) (50 mL falcon tube) ðŸ¥½
- ADT stock from -80 C freezer. (ADT batch from 11/8 is 7.5 mM)

- 2x amicon centricons; 4x amicon tubes
- 2x 15 mL falcontubes
- PD-10 column (already in Jodie)

## Procedure
### Calculation 
The amount of reactants used must be calculated accordingly.

### Reaction
1. Record a blank spectra of activation buffer.
2. Add activation buffer and enzyme in a 15 mL falcon tube and record a spectrum. This is your timepoint -0.
3. Then add NaDT and record a spectrum after 5 min and after 10 min.
4. Add ADT.
5. Record spectrum every 30 min until it doesn't change anymore.
6. Prepare the desalting buffer: 2 mM NaDT, 10 mM Tris-HCl (5 mL 100mM Tris pH8 in 45 mL dH2O in the falcon tube with NaDT)
7. Wash coloumn with desalting buffer with min. 3 CVs.
8. Load the reaction mixture to the column. Allow the sample to enter the column completly then gently add 2 to 3 mL desalting buffer.
9. Collcet the dark brown band in a fresh 15 mL falcon tube.
10. Concentrate the reconstituted protein.
11. Measure Fe/protein.
12. Freez in lq N2. Store aliquoted at -80 C.

## Notes

NaPi pH6.8 can be created by mixing 13.124 g Na2HPO4 and 7.043 g NaH2HPO4 and fill up to 1 L.
