## Introduction
The ability of Hybrid Cluster Protein and Carbon Monoxide Dehydrogenases to reduce Hydroxylamine to Ammonia and Water has been reported. 


## Material and Equipment

- Buffer: HEPES pH 8 (100 mM HEPES pH 8.0 and 100 mM NaCl)
- Methyl Viologen (100 mM, 25.72 mg/ml) 🥽🥼🧤❗
- Sodium Dithionite (1 M, 174.1 mg/ml) 🥽
- Hydroxylamine (1 M, 33.03 mg/ml) 🥽🥼🧤❗❗

## Procedure

### Redox-Titration
1. Fill cuvette with Buffer, xx µL NH2OH to different conc. and add xx µL MV to a conc of 10 mM.
	1. The concentration of hydroxylamine was varied from 0.5 to 100 mM.

| **NH2OH [mM]** |        **1** |       **10** |      **100** |
|----------------|-------------:|-------------:|-------------:|
| Buffer         |       989 µL |       980 µL |       890 µL |
| MV (100 mM)    |        10 µL |        10 µL |        10 µL |
| NaDT (500 mM)     |         <1 µL |         <1 µL |         <1 µL |
| NH2OH (1 M)    |         1 µL |        10 µL |       100 µL |
| **Total**      | **1000 + X** | **1000 + X** | **1000 + X** |

2. Add NaDT in 1 µL increments until Absorption Max at 578 nm reaches 1.2 (ε578 = 9.7 mM–1cm-1, therefore here: 9.7 mM Reduced MV)
3. Observe stability of mixture for some time. 
4. When no significant changes in absorbance were observed, the reaction is started by adding 1 µM Enzyem. .. this is a fucking lot. this would be 10 µL from 100 µM stock. I need to halve everything! At least! Maybe just take out half of the titrated one. 
5. Monitored for 300 s


## Notes

Assays were performed anaerobically under an N2 atmosphere in a 1.0-ml assay mixture containing metal-free CHES (100 mM, pH 9.0), EDTA (10 μM), and methyl viologen (MV; 10 mM). For the assay, a specific amount of NH2OH was added to the anaerobically prepared assay mixture in cuvettes (1.5 ml), and this solution was then poised with DTH to reduce MV (in most assays, MV in the assay solution was reduced to give an absorption at 578 nm [A578] near 1). Once the assay solution was properly poised, the purified HCP sample was added to the vial and the vial was immediately placed into the spectrophotometer. All spectra presented in this paper were recorded on a Shimadzu 1605 dual-beam spectrophotometer. The overall decrease in A578 (oxidation of reduced MV) was monitored for 20 s. This slope was then used to calculate the rate of NH2OH reduction performed by the enzyme. The optimal activity for NH2OH reduction by HCP was observed near pH 9. Therefore, most assays for NH2OH reduction were performed at pH 9.0 unless otherwise stated. A control assay without enzyme was also performed, and there was no significant decrease in A578. Activities are expressed as micromoles of NH2OH reduced per minute per milligram of protein. For comparison with the hydroxylamine reductase activity observed in CODH, the assays were also performed at pH 7.5.

NH2OH-Reduction and CO-Oxidation Assay. Hydroxylamine reduction activity was assayed as previously described by Wolfe et al.[19] monitoring the oxidation of reduced methyl viologen (MVred). In 2 mL quartz cuvettes, a buffer (100 mM HEPES pH 8.0 and 100 mM NaCl) was added and incubated for 2 min at 40 °C, before a base line spectrum was recorded. Subsequently added oxidized MV (final concentration: 10 mM) was reductively titrated with dithionite solution, until a final absorption of 1.2 at 578 nm (A578) was obtained. The concentration of hydroxylamine was varied from 0.5 to 100 mM. When no significant changes in absorbance were observed, the reaction was started by adding 1 µM CooS-VCh and monitored for 300 s. Initial rates were determined and specific activities calculated using the extinction coefficient of MVred at 578 nm (ε578 = 9.7 mM–1cm–1). The steady-state kinetic constants Km and kcat were determined by fitting the experimental data with a nonlinear regression applying the Michaelis-Menten equation in GraFit 5.[20]
