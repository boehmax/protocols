## Procedure

### Calibration
To use an analytic SEC to estimate the size of your protein, a calibration needs to be performed. This is done by running proteins with known MW on the colomen and generating a kalibration kurve of Eltuion time vs MW. We use the commercial kit from Citiva (LMW or HMW) but a self mixed calibration is as good! Most of the information was taken from the Citiva *Gel Filtration Calibration kit - Instructions for Use*
1. Equilibration of column. A buffer with a ionic strenght of >= 0.15 is suggested. 
1. Choice of calibration proteins.

3. Prepare protein stocks for calibration of 20mg/mL in a buffer between pH 6 and 8 with an ionic strenght of 0.15 or greater (e.g. 50 mM phosphate, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.2.)
4. For use in a glovebox, prepare them in one, aliquot them in apropriate sizes and freez them in cryo tubes.
5. Mix protein in appropriate concentrations, to get peaks of similar hight.

7. Apply the mix on the column. The sample olume should not exceed 2% of the geometric column Volume (Vc)! (e.g. for our 24mL only have a sample volume of 480 ÂµL or less!)
8. Determine the elution volume (Ve)

7. Determine the void volume (Vo). This is done by running a **fresh** solution of Blue Dextran 2000 in the sample buffer, with a concentration of 1.0mg/mL and a sample size of 0.5% of Vc. Run it by its own! It gets a very broad peak.
8. Calculate Kav for all the proteins like so:
$$
K_{av}=\frac{V_e-V_o}{V_c-V_o}
$$
9. Prepare calibration kurve as Kav vs log molecular weight.

### Molecular weight determination
1. Apply unknown sample (volume 0.1% to 2% of Vc)
2. Determine elution volume.
3. Calculate Kav and use the kalibration kurve to determin the molecular weight.
4. Note: For lipo or gluco proteins the Stoke's Radius might be a better parameter, sinze their elution is not only related to their weight. for this create a $\sqrt{(-logK_{av})}$ vs $R_{St}$ 

## Notes

[Does a different Buffer make a different elution profile?](https://www.cytivalifesciences.com/en/us/solutions/protein-research/knowledge-center/protein-purification-methods/how-buffer-ph-and-nacl-affect-size-exclusion-chromatography)
