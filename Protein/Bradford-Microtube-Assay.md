# Bradford Microtube Assay
**Last Updated:** 2022-03-28
**Author(s):** Maximilian BÃ¶hm

## Introduction
SOP for protein concentration measurement when 280nm measurement is not available (e.g. due to FeS clusters). Suitable for a protein concentration between 1 to 25 Âµg/ml. Instructions from [ThermoFisher Coomassie (Bradford) Protein Assay Kit 23200](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/23200).

## Material
- Bradford reagent (Volume needed = 500 ÂµL * (Samples + Standard)) ðŸ§¤
- BSA protein standard (2 mg/ml)
- Protein sample

## Procedure

### Before you start
1. Take out Bradford reagent from the fridge, and fill it in a 15ml Falcon tube. 
3. Prepare kuvetts. 
4. Turn on the UV/vis spectrometer to warm up the lamp.

### Prepare standard
1. Everything should be done in triplicates.
2. Dilute BSA standard to a concentration of 100 Âµg/ml (1 to 20), you will need at least 350ÂµL. Vortex. 
1. Dilute further as depicted below. Do this directly in kuvetts


| Standard [Âµg/mL]       | 0 | 1 | 5 | 10 | 20 | 25|
| :------------- |-------------:| -----:| -----:|-----:| -----:| -----:| 
| BSA Standard (100 Âµg/mL)    | 0 | 5 | 25 | 50 | 100 | 125 |
| dH2O     | 500| 495 | 475 | 450 | 400 | 375|   

### Prepare Sample
1. Dilute protein sample adequately. Eg 1:1000, 1:2000. Vortex vigorously.
2. Separate into three portions of 500 ÂµL in kuvetts.

### Starting the Assay
1. Start a timer. Try to have the same intervals (e.g 30sec) between samples. Both for Step 10 and Step 12.
2. Add 500 ÂµL of Bradford Reagent.
3. Incubate for 10 min at RT.
4. Measure absorbance of samples at 595nm. 

### Evaluation
1. Make calibration curve with error bars in a program of choice.
2. Use calibration curve to check protein concentration. Note that you have diluted your Sample earlier! Calculate the concentration of the Stock solution.
