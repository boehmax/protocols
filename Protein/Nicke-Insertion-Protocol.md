# Nickel Insertion Protocol

**Last Updated**: 2023-11-17
**Authors**: 

## Introduction
It has been shown that Nickel can be inserted into CODHs in vitro by incubating with Nickel and reductant for some time. I tried to replicate this now for some time, but I have not managed to do so. This can have multiple reasons:
1. CODH was deactivated by oxygen earlier on and only has residual activity. (EPR and FTIR speak against this.)
2. The reducing power of NaDT that is used in the literature protocol was not good enough.
3. The protocol just doesnt work, and the increase in activity that they see is just an initial activation of the enzyme, pushing it out of its ox inactive state.

### Goal
Finding conditions to put the nickel in the cluster. Parralels to Gustave syntethic cofactor approach.

### Assumptions
- Ni bound in the NiFeS cluster is thermodynamically stable
- Ni insertion is mainly limited due to access to the active site (buried)
- CODH activity depends mainly on Ni occupancy
- CODH change conformation at active site dependent on redox state

### Literature 
- DvCODH changes conformation at the active site, dependent on redox state [[2018Wittenborn_Redox-dependent_rearrangements_of_the_NiFeS_cluster_of_carbon_monoxide 1.pdf]]
“the extent of the activation with Na2S is less significant than the activation observed with NiCl2 and NaDT treatment, which activates the enzyme almost 50 fold. (1.2 mM NaDT, 2.4 mM NiCl2)” ([Benvenuti, 2019, p. 136](zotero://select/library/items/IGLL4GKE)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPKBY3YC?page=136&annotation=XKL2PIFE))

“We have discovered that this problem [Formation of NiS precipiate] can be overcome if we include either tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, a reducing agent” ([Benvenuti, 2019, p. 137](zotero://select/library/items/IGLL4GKE)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPKBY3YC?page=137&annotation=Z3NTC2X6))

“As shown in Figure 1, we observed that the optimal concentration of NiCl2 is 2.4 mM whereas it is in between 2.4 mM and 6 mM for Na2” ([Benvenuti, 2019, p. 138](zotero://select/library/items/IGLL4GKE)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPKBY3YC?page=138&annotation=BUAMPXVF))

“we tried to activate the enzyme with another reducing compound which lacks sulfide, titanium-citrate” ([Benvenuti, 2019, p. 139](zotero://select/library/items/IGLL4GKE)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPKBY3YC?page=139&annotation=G54PVEPY))

“NiCl2 + titanium-citrate activation is less pronounced than the NiCl2 + Na2” ([Benvenuti, 2019, p. 139](zotero://select/library/items/IGLL4GKE)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPKBY3YC?page=139&annotation=UEB4UB9Q))

“sulfide is needed to increase the extent of the activation.” ([Benvenuti, 2019, p. 139](zotero://select/library/items/IGLL4GKE)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPKBY3YC?page=139&annotation=CH99WY9T))

“This series of results suggest that the NiCl2 + Na2S treatment is maximal and that the other protocols only activate a fraction of the protein sample.” ([Benvenuti, 2019, p. 141](zotero://select/library/items/IGLL4GKE)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPKBY3YC?page=141&annotation=WTQD4VW8))

“confirming the requirement of sulfide as activating agent and not as a simple reductant” ([Benvenuti, 2019, p. 142](zotero://select/library/items/IGLL4GKE)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPKBY3YC?page=142&annotation=8IHPZYIT))

“Prior recording the activity, the Dv CODH sample was diluted to 0.44 μM in 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH8 and treated with the following compounds: 2.4 mM NiCl2 + 1.2 mM NaDT, 2.4 mM NiCl2 + 4 mM Na2S, 2.4 mM NiCl2 + 1.2 mM titanium-citrate or 2.4 mM CoCl2 + 4 mM Na2” ([Benvenuti, 2019, p. 152](zotero://select/library/items/IGLL4GKE)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPKBY3YC?page=152&annotation=L4XHWQFQ))

- Ni insertion in vitro is possible for ChCODH II
“Um das Enzym zu aktivieren, wurde es zunächst in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mM DT, 2 mM DTT verdünnt und mindestens eine Stunde inkubiert.” ([Domnik, 2018, p. 39](zotero://select/library/items/KV4UYVZ7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MCA33PWR?page=39&annotation=2SWQ8E2D))
- CODH get oxidised by NH2OH
- CODH get reduced by NaDT
- Urea/Guanidine destabilize protein folding

### Idea
1. Loosen up CODH (Urea/Guanidine)
2. Opening up CODH (RedOxState1)
3. Putting the Nickel
4. Closing up CODH (RedOxState2)
5. Washing.
