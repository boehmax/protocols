## Introduction
*Taken from a protocol written in a undergrad lab by me.* Phycobiliproteins or chromoproteins are the main part of the light harvesting systems of plants and cyanobacteria. They absorb light and channel the resulting energy to  the Reaction Centre of the organism. Spirulina cells contain a high number of the two phycobiliproteins, phycocyanin and allophycocyanin. Both proteins relate their high light absorbing properties to the phycocyanobilin, an open-chain tetrapyrrole chromophore, embedded and covalently bond as thioether to a single cysteine residue in the proteins. [2000Bowen](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ed077p1456)

In their native form the proteins have intense ﬂuorescence, which is decreased with the denaturation of the protein due to conformational changes of the phycocyanobilin into a closed lock wash conformation


## Material and Equipment
- Spirulina Algae Powder
- Falcon Tube or Eppendorf tube
- 0.15 M Phosphate Buffer pH 7

## Procedure
1. 0.1 g Spirulina Algae Powder mixed in 7 mL buffer.
	- Disrupting the cells further by sonication or wild shaking, will change the coulure outcome.
	- For smaller aliquots, we should prepare some Eppis ourself, with the powder already in them.
1. Centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 10 min.
2. Separate Blue/green supernatant from insoluble pellet.
3. Investigate colour and fluorescence.
	- By adding acetone most of the fluorescence is lost.
	- By adding EtOH, the fluorescence changes to blue.
	- By adding urea the fluorescence is lost.

(0 M(green) to 6 M (blue). B. Fluorescence spectra of phycobiliprotein solution with a
concentration of 6 M urea (0 d (green) to 6 d (blue)).
