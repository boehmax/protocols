# CODH activity - CO oxidation

**Last Updated**: 2023-03-15
**Authors**: Max

## Introduction
With this assay you can monitor the oxidation of CO (or any substrate), indirectly by the subsequence reduction of methyl viologen to its radical semiquinone with a strong absorbance at 604 nm. This protocol was taken from and adapted from [[2019Benvenuti]] to be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2020.148188).

## Material and Equipment

- Buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl)
- Methyl Viologen (MV) (25 mM, 6.43 mg/mL in Buffer) 🥼🥽🧤❗
- Sodium dithionite (NaDT) (100 mM, 17.4 mg/mL in Buffer) 🥽
- CO gas ❗❗
- Enzyme (0.44 µM in Buffer)
- Kuvetts/Plates

## Procedure
1. Prepare a CO saturated buffer by first fetching the CO-detector, checking if its working! **CO gas is toxic!** Please make sure you are trained and aware of the dangers!
2. Then bubbeling 3 ml of buffer. Use a glass vile with a rubber septum an bubble for 5 to 10 min. 
3. Transfer everything in the glove box. Dilute NaDT 1:10, to get a 10 mM solution.
4. For 1 mL Reaction Mixture: 100µL MV, 1 µL NaDT, and 899µL Buffer. Prepare enough for multiple samples in a falcon tube, or prepare less directly in a cuvette.
	- The mixture should have a very faint blue colour.
5. Add 5 µL of enzyme to one kuvett.
6. Use Method:                    . 
	- In this method the reduction of MV is followed by the increase in absorbance at 604 nm. $\epsilon$  = 9.92 1/mM/cm (measured by myself.)
	1. Insert cuvette and measure spectrum.
	2. When the prompt comes, add 25 µL of the CO saturated buffer with a Hamiltonian syringe, mix with a Pipett and press ok.
	3. After the measurement the program will ask you to insert another cuvette. Add another cuvette if you want to measure multiple samples, otherwise press cancel.
	- Note down in your lab book which cell has which sample! The program supports sample lists, but I think its easier to just note it down separately.

## Notes
- CO saturated solution would be nice to have the calculations on hand. The way we prepare our sample it is yielding a conc of 25µM CO in the solution (according to the paper cited above, but i didn't double check this. Henry's Law.)
- MV waste needs to be collected and thrown away in special containers
