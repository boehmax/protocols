# Lysis Buffer Screening

**Last Updated**: 2022-12-12
**Authors**: Max

## Introduction
This is a short Method on how to screen quickly for the optimal lysis buffer.


## Material and Equipment

### Chemicals
- 10% desoxycolate
- 10% Tween
- L Buffer (50 mM Tris. pH8, 20 mM NaCl)
- 1 M Tris HCl pH 8
- 1 M NaCl
- 1 M MgCl2
- 1 M KCl
- 40% Sucrose
- 40% Glucose
- 80% Glycerol
- 10% Glycine 
### Material
- 96-deep Well plate (one for growing and one for Storing Lysis-Solutions)
- Multichannel pipett and tipps


## Procedure
### Days Before
1. Grow cells and start expression the the day before.
2. Make SDS pages with appropriate %. Don't use precasted ones, those are expensive, we dont need a super pretty gel for this initial screening.
### The day of Experiment
4. Collect cells in falcon tubes. Resuspend in 25 mL Buffer.
5. Aliquot in 1 mL in Fast centrifugation tubes.
6. Pellet cells, discharge supernatant.
7. Prepare lysis buffer, plain. 75 mg Lysosyme, 1 spatespitze DNAse, 1 spatelspitze RNAse, 1/2 protease tablet, in 25 mL L Buffer
8. Add 1 mL to each tube. Keep cool. Dont resuspend.
9. Add Additional lysis agents.
10. Vortex sample and keep on RT for 1 h.
11. Centrifuge at max speed for 1 h.
12. Take xx ÂµL of the supernatent to make an SDS page.
