NO Reductase Activity Assay. We used two different assays to monitor NO reductase activity of CooS-VCh: 1) detecting NADH 
oxidation by the enzyme hybrid cluster protein reductase (HCR) from E. coli by time-dependent absorbance measurement at 340 nm 
and 2) use of gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS) to detect NO consumption and N2O production from the gas 
phase of the reaction vessel. NO gas was purged through 1 M NaOH solution and quantified by formation of a NO-myoglobin complex 
with an ε at 421 nm (114 mM-1 cm-1).[21]  
1) Time-dependent absorbance at 340 nm. The gene encoding HCR from E. coli BL21 (DE3) was cloned into a pET28 vector and 
HCR was aerobically expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) using an autoinduction medium.[22] HCR was purified by affinity chromatography 
using the N-terminal his-tag according to the manufacturer's recommendations (GE Healthcare). After the reconstitution, HCR 
possessed 1.9 Fe and 1.2 FAD per mole of protein.  
We followed the reduction of CooS-VCh (0.2 µM) by adding HCR (2.5 µM) with 250 µM NADH as reducing agent, which was monitored 
by the decreasing absorption at 450 nm. The observed rate constant (kobs) of reduction of CooS-VCh by HCR of 50/min was 
determined by fitting a single-exponential function.  
To measure NO reduction activity, 40 nM CooS-VCh and 160 nM HCR in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 were mixed in a gas-tight cuvette 
without any gas phase. The reaction was started by adding ~240 µM NO solution and the decrease in NADH concentration was 
monitored at 340 nm. NADH consumption was quantified using an ε340nm of 6.22 m-1 cm-1. 2) Use of GC/MS. We adapted our assay 23 with a modification of the SIM mode (m/z=30 for NO and m/z=44 for N2O) to detect NO 
and N2O in the reaction vessel by MS. Two reduction methods were used: with HCR and NADH as in (1) and benzyl viologen and Na-
DT as reductants. The reaction contained 40 nM CooS-V in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 with either 150 nM HCR and 600 µM NADH or 
5 mM Na-DT and 1 mM benzylviologen as reducing agent in 1 ml solution with 2 ml of gas phase. 100 µl of gas phase was injected 
into the GC/MS at different times during the reaction. 
We also performed different control experiments: 1. Only HCR and NADH, 2. Only NADH, 3. Only benzylviologen and Na-DT without 
CooS-VCh
