# CODH-activity-CO2-reduction-mDQ

**Last Updated**: 2025-02-12

## Introduction
We are unsure, if tested CODH are unactive towards CO2 reduction beacause of their inherent properties, or because the drivingfoce we give with the usually electron shuttles, is not big enough.
The therefore designed a experiment as in [[CODH-activity-CO2-reduction]] just with mDQ (-0.65 V) instead of MV (-0.42V) .


## Material and Equipment

- Buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 20 mM NaCl)
- Dimethyl Diquot Dibromide (MV) (25 mM, 9.30 mg/mL in Buffer) ü•ºü•Ωüß§‚ùó
	- MW 212.29 + 2 * 79.90= 372.09 
	- [C14H16N2]Br2
- Europium Chloride (100 mM, 25.8 mg/mL in Buffer) (Stored in Maggie, Fridge)
	- MW = 258.323
- EDGA (ethylene glycol-bis(2-aminoethyl ether)-_N_,_N_,_N_‚Ä≤,_N_‚Ä≤-tetraacetate) (100 mM, 38.0 mg/mL in Buffer)
	- MW =  380.35
- Sodiumbicarbonate (NaHCO3) (100 mM, 8.40 mg/mL in Buffer)
- [[Hemoglobin]] (Hb) (31.25 ¬µM, 2.0 mg/mL in Buffer) üß§
- Enzyme (0.25 mg/ml, for a "normal" CODH of ~68kDa, that is 3.68 ¬µM)
- Kuvetts/Plates


## Procedure

### Activation of CODH
1. Bubble CO in buffer
2. Dilute protein to desired concentration with this CO saturated buffer
3. leave sit for 10 min or longer.
	- CO in the buffer will react with the Hb in the assay mix, this should be noted but overall not that much, since we are adding only 10 - 50 uL enzyme to a 1000 uL mix

### CO2 reduction 

4. Prepare MV, NaDT, Hb, NaHCO3 and Enzyme inside the glovebox.
	- for dissolving NaHCO3: The equilibrium between NaHCO3 and CO2 is reached slowly. Give it at least 20 min at rt. Hold vile closed.
5. Prepare EuEGTA by combinding equimolar ratios of EuCl2 and EGTA. 
	1. 500 uL 100 mM each, ending up with 1mL 50 mM EuEGTA.
6. Mix the following in a cuvette: 820 ¬µL Buffer, 10 ¬µL mDQ, 40 ¬µL EuEGTA, 50 ¬µL Hb and 100 ¬µL NaHCO3.
	- This Yields a final concentration of: 250 ¬µM mDQ, 2 mM EuEGTA, 0.1mg/mL Hb and 10 mM NaHCO3.
7. Measure with Method:                        . This will measure the absorbance at 429nm and 413nm.
8. If solution stable, prepare a new one and add 10 ¬µL of Enzyme (2.5 ¬µg). Mix with pipetting with 1000p up and down. (Two pipettes in your hands. Takes some practice.)
		- To check if the solution is 'stable', do a blank measurement without adding enzyme. A slope below 10^{-5} to 10^{-6} OD/sec can be considered background.
9. Press okay, and let instrument measure. After the measurement it will aske you to insert the next cuvette. Do so if you want to continue with another measurement and press ok. If not press cancel. (Your progress will be saved.)
10. Note the slope of OD(429nm)/sec.



## Notes

- concentrations of EGTA close or above 1 M need base to be made soluble
- reduced mDQ is not stable for very long, it should only be reduced seconds before the assay is started.
- Quartz cuvettes are preferred.
- Some CODH need to be activated by incubating with CO for 10 min.
