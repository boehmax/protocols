## Writing Guide

### Write plainly to improve clarity

Change `in order to` to `to`.

Change `utilize` to `use` (unless you are utilizing something for an unintended purpose).

Here are some examples of [words and phrases to avoid from Laura Helmuth](https://twitter.com/laurahelmuth/status/1158039072067264515?s=12), and the replies have some others' corrections (and pet peeves).

### Singular/plural and ensure noun-verb agreement

`The group of animals are found in Hawaii.`: Replace `are` with `is` to agree with the singular `group`.

The word `data` is plural. Many will disagree, and in modern usage it is often used as a "singular mass noun." But we don't!

### Which vs that

`which` typically follows a comma, while `that` does not:

The bacteria grew well, which indicated that the mutation did not impact viability.

### Capitalization

`Gram` (Gram stain; Gram-negative; Gram-positive) is capitalized for [Hans Christian Gram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Christian_Gram).

`Southern` blot capitalized for [Edwin Southern]; northern blot and western blot are lowercase.

Some journals may disagree.

### Separating clauses

#### However

Improper use:

```Blah blah, however bluh bluh.```

Proper alternatives (as long as "blah blah" and "bluh bluh" are both independent clauses):

```
Blah blah. However, bluh bluh.
Blah blah; however, bluh bluh.
Blah blah, yet bluh bluh.
```

#### And (and commas)

Use a comma before `and` only if you are joining two independent clauses (i.e., two phrases that could be full sentences on their own):

Improper use:

```
This experience allowed me to learn more, and impacted my life.
```

Proper alternatives:

```
This experience allowed me to learn more and impacted my life.
This experience allowed me to learn more, and it impacted my life.
```

### Space out

There should be a space between a value and its unit.

```
8 mm
25 °C
100 μl
```

The exception to this if you are describing an angle: `90° right angle`

### Special characters

In general, use unicode symbols, not the symbol font. This way, as you change fonts (or submit your abstract to an online system, etc.) you do not lose information.

Mac shortcuts (if known):

| Symbol  | Keyboard Shortcut  |
|---------|--------------------|
| µ       | Option-m           |
| ∆       | Option-j           |
| ≤       | Option-,           |
| ≥       | Option-.           |
| ≈       | Option-x           |
| ‰       | Option-Shift-R     |
| π       | Option-p           |
| β       |                    |
| λ       |                    |
| σ       |                    |
| α       |                    |

Use `µl` instead of `ul`

Another hack: copy the symbols you need from above, or from a [relevant Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet). Paste them without formatting (e.g., in your browser's address bar) to confirm that you have a unicode symbol, then copy it from there and paste the plain text version of it into your document.

### Italics

- `7` in Tn*7* 
- `5` in Tn*5*
- *in vivo*
- *in vitro*

Additional detail above in the [Style Guide](#style-guide) for genes, promoters, etc.

### American English

Use the common American English spelling and usage (unless writing specifically for a British English audience).

| Use             | Avoid            |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Acknowledgments | Acknowledgements |
| behavior        | behaviour        |
| color           | colour           |
| among           | amongst          |


### Wild type vs wild-type

I'll admit to often getting this one wrong! `Wild-type` is an adjective (`wild-type bacterium`) whereas 
`wild type` is a noun (`the wild type did not have the phenotype`). [This post from Kathryn Sobek](https://filipodia.com/2017/03/01/is-it-wild-type-or-wild-type/) has additional examples.

### References

Include spaces before citations (unless they are superscript, or this format is required by the journal). 

`See this paper(10)` should instead be: `See this paper (10)`

When possible, put all references at the end of the sentence. It makes it easier for the reader to read and understand your writing. the exception to this is when you have a citation that must be cited precisely with a certain word/phrase, such as:

`The consensus in the literature is X (1, 2), but our data suggest otherwise (Fig. 2).`

In the bibliography list, pay attention to formatting. Italicize genus/species/gene names if they are italicized in the original manuscript title. Use superscript/subscript as appropriate. Here is code you can add to your titles in Paperpile so that it fills correctly:


<i>Vibrio fischeri</i> colonizes the Hawaiian bobtail squid, <i>Euprymna scolopes</i>
Transcription is controlled by σ<sup>54</sup>
Subscripts are less common in paper titles<sub>Am I right?</sub>


### This

Whenever you have a sentence that begins with `This`, be sure you are explaining what `This` is.

As examples:

`This highlights the power of our approach.` might be better expressed as `The depth of the results we obtained highlights the power of our approach.`

`This makes it clear that more investigation is needed.` could be `This finding that many insertions cannot be explained makes it clear that more investigation is needed.`

### Hyphenation

Avoid hyphenation on posters. When you have narrow text blocks, many programs will hyphenate the ends of lines. This becomes distracting when it occurs too often.

This issue occurs frequently in Illustrator for posters: In `Paragraph`, deselect the `Hyphenate` option.

This issue occurs rarely in Word, though you can disable hyphenation in `Paragraph` | `Line and Page Breaks` | `Don't hyphenate`

### Tracking changes

After accepting/rejecting comments, be sure to review for issues of 2 spaces or 2 periods in a row. Do a search in the whole document for these issues, and review each manually.
