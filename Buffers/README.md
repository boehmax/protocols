# Buffers & Media

This directory contains recipes and preparation protocols for commonly used buffers and growth media.

## Available Protocols

### Electrophoresis Buffers
- **[Electrophoresis Buffers](./Electrophoresis-Buffers.md)** - Complete collection of buffers for SDS-PAGE and agarose gel electrophoresis
  - SDS running buffers
  - Staining and destaining solutions
  - TAE buffer for agarose gels
  - Storage solutions

### Growth Media
- **[M9 Media](./M9-media-B.md)** - Minimal defined medium for bacterial growth
  - Useful for isotope labeling experiments
  - Controlled nutrient conditions

## Buffer Categories

### SDS-PAGE System
- **Running buffer**: 10x stock solution for gel electrophoresis
- **Staining solution**: Coomassie blue for protein visualization
- **Destaining solution**: For background removal
- **Storage solution**: For long-term gel preservation

### DNA Electrophoresis
- **TAE buffer**: Standard buffer for agarose gel electrophoresis
- **EDTA solution**: Metal chelator component

### Growth Media
- **M9 minimal medium**: Defined medium with controlled composition

## Preparation Guidelines

### General Best Practices
- Use high-quality reagents (molecular biology grade when specified)
- Filter sterilize heat-sensitive components
- Autoclave heat-stable solutions
- Store at appropriate temperatures
- Label clearly with preparation date

### Quality Control
- Check pH of buffer solutions
- Test media for sterility before use
- Verify buffer performance with known samples
- Replace old stocks regularly

### Storage Recommendations
- Most buffers stable at 4Â°C for several months
- Some components better stored at room temperature
- Avoid freeze-thaw cycles for protein-containing buffers
- Monitor for precipitation or contamination

## Usage Notes

### Electrophoresis Buffers
- Dilute stock solutions to working concentration before use
- SDS can precipitate at low temperatures
- Coomassie staining requires methanol - work in ventilated area

### Growth Media
- M9 requires supplementation with carbon source and other nutrients
- Sterilize components separately if needed
- Add antibiotics after cooling to appropriate temperature
