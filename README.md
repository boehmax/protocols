Welcome to my protocols page. Here, I have outlined the procedures I follow on a regular basis.

You are welcome to reference or adapt these protocols. If you notice any errors or areas for improvement, I would greatly appreciate it if you informed me.

Before publishing any work based on these protocols, please consult with me in advance. Thank you.
